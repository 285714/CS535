\section{Introduction}

In the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP), we are given a truth table of some Boolean function together with a positive integer $s_n$ as input, and our task is to answer the question whether there exists a circuit of size at most $s_n$ that computes the function represented by the given truth table.

It is easy to see that $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\NP$. Namely, we can define a certificate as some proposed circuit $C$ of size at most $s_n$, and verify whether $C$ computes each entry of the truth table correctly in polynomial time. With that being said, a natural question arises: Is $\mathprob{MCSP}$  $\NP$-complete?

In ``Circuit Minimization Problem,'' Valentine Kabanets and Jin-Yi Cai addressed the difficulty of showing $\mathprob{MCSP}$ to be $\NP$-hard \cite{10.1145/335305.335314}. They showed some consequences that are unlikely to happen if there exists a polynomial-time reduction $R$ from $\mathprob{SAT}$ to $\mathprob{MCSP}$ that is ``natural,'' in the sense that the size of the output depends on the size of the inputs only, and these sizes are polynomially related.  Furthermore, the authors pointed out why it is challenging to prove $\mathprob{MCSP} \notin \P$ (again, by providing some consequences whose likelihood is questionable). Clearly, such proof would imply $\P \neq \NP$ which goes beyond the currently known techniques. 

In this review, we will provide some definitions required to understand the main results and key theorems of the paper in Section 2. Section 3 introduces some main consequences when $\mathprob{MCSP} \notin \P$ and $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under ``natural'' reductions. Finally, we conclude the review by providing some insightful remarks and directions for further research on this topic in Section 4.

\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we provide some definitions that, we believe, are useful for the readers including some complexity classes, Natural (Karp) Reduction, and Pseudorandom Generators.

\subsection{Some Complexity Classes}
We start with providing necessary definitions for some complexity classes.
For more details and a full discussion, see \cite{arora2009}.

\begin{definition}
  The class \emph{sub-exponential} is
  $\class{SUBEXP} \coloneqq \bigcap_{\epsilon > 0} \TIME(2^{n^{\epsilon}})$.
\end{definition}

Note that $\class{SUBEXP}$ is not empty, even though it is defined as an infimum
over complexity classes. This is because a language might be decided by a
different TM for every $\varepsilon > 0$.

\begin{definition}
	The class $\class{QP}$ of languages decided by a TM in
	\emph{quasi-polynomial} time defined by
	\[
	\class{QP}
	\coloneqq
	\TIME(n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)})
	=
	\bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(2^{\log^c n})
	=
	\bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(n^{\log^c n})
	\]
\end{definition}
We obtain the last equality since
$2^{(\log n)^{c+1}} = (2^{\log n})^{\log^c n} = n^{\log^c n}$.
%
Note that $\class{QP}$ contains $\P$ since
$\mathrm{polylog}(n) \in \Omega(1)$.

Also, $\class{SUBEXP}$ contains $\class{QP}$ since for every
$\varepsilon > 0$ and $c > 1$ holds that
$\exp(\log^c n) \in o(\exp(n^\varepsilon))$.\footnote{To analyze the
relationship of exponentials, the following proofs useful:
For functions $f, g \colon \N_+ \to \N_+$ holds
$2^{f(n)} \in o(2^{g(n)})$ if and only if $g(n) - f(n) \to \infty$ for
$n \to \infty$.
This is easily seen by using the limit definition of Landau symbols, namely
\[
  f(n) \in o(g(n))
  \iff
  0 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2^{f(n)}}{2^{g(n)}}
  = \lim_{n \to \infty} \exp(f(n) - g(n))
  \iff
  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(n) - g(n) = -\infty \,.
\]}


\begin{definition}
  The class \emph{exponential time with linear exponent} is defined as
	$\class{E} \coloneqq \TIME(2^{O(n)})$.
\end{definition}

Since $\log^c n \in O(n)$ for any $c > 0$, we obtain that
$\class{QP} \subseteq \class E$.


\subsection{Natural Reductions}

In this subsection, we will provide you the definition of \textit{Natural Reduction} in two versions.
% should we?
The informal version will provide some general intuition of the natural reduction while the formal one will specify more technical properties of the ``mapping'' process.  

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Natural (Karp) Reduction}: For two problems $A$ and $B$ and a Karp reduction from $A$ to $B$, we say the reduction $R$ is natural if, for any instance $I$ of $A$, the length of the output $|R(I)|$, as well as all possible output parameters $s_n$, depend only on the input length $|I|$. Furthermore, $|I|$ and $|R(I)|$ are polynomial related.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Assume we are given two languages $A$ and $B$, where $B$ describes the
  decision version of a search problem, meaning its instances are of the kind
  $\langle y, s \rangle \in B$ where $s \in \N$ is a numerical parameter.
  A many-one reduction $R = \langle R_1, R_2 \rangle$ from $A$ to $B$, whereas
  $R_1$ maps to instances $y$ of the original search problem and $R_2$ to the
  parameters $s$, is called \emph{natural} if for all instances $x$ of $A$ holds
  that
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there exists a $c \in \R_+$ such that
      $|x|^{1/c} \le |R(x)| \le |x|^c$, meaning $R_1$ does not suddenly grow or
      shrink, and
    \item $R_2$ depends only on the length of the instance $x$, i.e. there
      exists a function $f \colon \N \to \N$ such that $R_2(I) = f(|x|)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
	
	For example, $\mathprob{SAT} \leq_p \mathprob{3SAT}$ is ``natural.'' Namely, given $\varphi$ - an instance in $\mathprob{SAT}$, the general idea is to split some clause $C$ in $\varphi$ of size $k > 3$ into a pair of two equivalent clauses $C_1$ of size $k - 1$ and $C_2$ of size $3$ and we repeat the process until we get the desired $3-CNF$ formula, $\varphi'$. Thus, the length of $\varphi'$ is only dependent on $\varphi$ as we just add more clauses solely based on everything from the original formula, intuitively speaking.
	
	Other textbook reductions that we know and love (such as $\mathprob{3SAT} \leq_p \mathprob{VERTEXCOVER}$, etc.) are ``natural'' in this sense.
% "in fact, all NP-complete parameterized problems we are aware of seem to be
%  complete under natural reductions."
%
%
\begin{example}
  We reduce from
  $\mathprob{Partition}$\footnote{The partition problem asks, given a multiset
  of positive integers $\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ whether there exists a partition
  $(S,T)$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ such that
  $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = \sum_{i \in T} a_i$.}
  to
  $\mathprob{SubsetSum}:$\footnote{The partition problem asks for an instance
  $\langle A, s \rangle$ of a multiset of positive integers
  $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and an integer $s$ whether there exists a subset
  $S \subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ such that
  $s = \sum_{i \in S} a_i$.}
  \[
    R(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \coloneqq
    \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \langle \{2, 4, 8\}, 7 \rangle
          & \textrm{if } \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \equiv_2 1 \\
        \langle \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}, \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \rangle
          & \textrm{otherwise} \,. \\
      \end{array}
    \right.
  \]
  Now, while this reduction is correct (if $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ is congruent to 1
  modulo 2, it is impossible to divide the set into two partitions of equal sum;
  the tuple $\langle \{2, 4, 8\}, 7 \rangle$ is a no-instance to
  $\mathprob{SubsetSum}$) and can be carried out in polynomial time.
  It is not natural for two reasons:
  First, the output size does not strictly depend on the input size as, in the
  case of an obvious no-instance to $\mathprob{Partition}$, we map directly to a
  no-instance of $\mathprob{SubsetSum}$ of constant size.
  Second, the numerical parameter $s$ is not a function of the input
  size only. For example, the two instances $\{1, \dots, 1\}$ ($n$-times) and
  $\{2^n\}$ are of equal size, but have totally different sums.
  With a little more care, we can, however, make this a natural reduction: Let
  \[
    \begin{array}{rrl}
      R'(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \coloneqq
        \langle \{2 a_1, \dots, 2 a_n, r,
         2^{\sigma+2} \rangle
      &\textrm{where}&
      \sigma \coloneqq \mathrm{size}(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \\
      &\textrm{and}&
      r \coloneqq 2^{\sigma+2} - \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \,.
    \end{array}
  \]
  Now, the numerical parameter $s$ is obviously only a function in the input
  size $\sigma$. Regarding correctness, first note that
  $2^{\sigma+2} > \sum_{i=1}^n 2 a_i$. This implies that any subset with a sum
  of $2^{\sigma+2}$ necessarily contains $r$ and thus
  \[
    \textstyle
    2^{\sigma+2} = r + \sum_{i \in S} 2a_i
    \iff
    \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n = \sum_{i \in S} a_i
  \]
  where $S$ is the rest of the subset without $r$.
\end{example}


\subsection{Infinitely-often Simulations}

We introduce a modifier to a complexity class $C$.

\begin{definition}
  A language $L$ belongs to the class
  $\io C$ if there is a language $A \in C$ such that
  $A$ and $L$ agree on infinitely many input lengths, i.e.
  \[
    |\set{ n \in \N \mid \forall x \in \{0,1\}^n\ A(x) = L(x) }| = \infty
  \]
\end{definition}

Note that $C$ is obviously containend in $\io C$.

% $L \in \almosteverywhere C$


\subsection{Pseudoramdom generator}
\label{pseudorandom}
\begin{definition}
	\textit{Pseudorandom generators}: A distribution $R$ over $\{0, 1\}^m$ is ($S, \epsilon$)-pseudorandom (for $S \in \N$, $\epsilon > 0$) if for every circuit $C$ of size at most $S$.
	\[|Pr[C(R) = 1] - Pr[C(U_m) = 1]| < \epsilon\]
	where $U_m$ denotes the uniform distribution over $\{0, 1\}^m$.
	
	Let $S: \N \rightarrow \N$ be some function. A $2^n$-time computable function $G: \{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^*$ is an $S(l)$-\textit{pseudorandom generator} if $|G(z)| = S(|z|)$ for every $z \in \{0, 1\}^*$ and for every $l \in \N$ the distribution $G(U_l)$ is $(S(l)^3, 1/10)$-pseudorandom.
	
	For more details and a full discussion of this topic, prefer to chapter 20 of \cite{arora2009}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} (\cite{10.1145/335305.335314})
	The \textit{hardness} $H(G_k)$ of a pseudorandom generator $G_k: \{0, 1\}^k \rightarrow \{0, 1\}^{2k}$ is defined as the minimal $s$ such that there exists a circuit $C$ of size at most $s$ for which
	\[|Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^k}[C(G_k(x)) = 1] - Pr_{x \in \{0, 1\}^{2k}}[C(y) = 1]| \geq 1/s\]
	
	The pseudorandom generator $G_k$ is called \textit{strong} if it has hardness $H(G_k) > 2^{k^{\Omega(1)}}$ 
\end{definition}

\section{Main Results}

\subsection{MCSP and NP-completeness}

To begin with, we want to emphasize that researchers have not figured out yet whether it is possible to prove the $\NP$-hardness of $\mathprob{MCSP}$ or not. The difficulty of such proof was explicitly addressed through some implications for \textit{Circuit Complexity} and $\BPP$. In other words, the authors provided some consequences that are still unknown to the current state of the art if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under the ``natural'' Karp reduction. 

Before we move on to some key theorems of this section, let us examine some lemmas that are useful for establishing.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:qp-collapse}
	$\class{QP}^{\class{QP}} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $M$ be a TM dedicing a language $L \in \class{QP}^{\class{QP}}$ in
  quasi-polynomial time, say $\exp(\log^c n)$.
  We show that carrying out the oracle computation instead of calling the
  oracle does still guarantee a quasi-polynomial running time. To this end,
  let $M'$ be the TM deciding the $\class{QP}$-oracle, say in time
  $\exp(\log^{c'} m)$.
  Now, any input to $M'$ is at most of length $m = \exp(\log^c n)$. We
  therefore need time at most
  $\exp(\log^c (\exp(\log^c n))) = \exp(\log^{cc'} n)$
  for one oracle computation. At the same time, there are at most
  $\exp(\log^c n)$ calls, resulting in a total running time bound of
  $\exp(\log^c (\exp(\log^{cc'} n))) = \exp(\log^{c^2 c'} n)$
  which is still quasi-polynomial.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:ph-sub-qp}
	If $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$ then
	$\class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Recall that we can define $\class{PH}$ in terms of oracles by
  \[
    \class{PH} =
    \bigcup_{n > 0} \underbrace{\NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}}_{n \textrm{ times}}
    \,.
  \]
  We can use a straithgforward induction over $n$ to show that
  $\class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
  Note that the induction basis is just the assumption.
  Furthermore, by the inductive hypothesis, we have that
  \[
    \underbrace{\NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}}_{n \textrm{ times}}
    \subseteq
    \class{QP}
    \quad
    \Longrightarrow
    \quad
    \underbrace{\NP^{\overbrace{
      \NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}
    }^{n \textrm{ times}}}}_{n+1 \textrm{ times}}
    \subseteq
    \NP^{\class{QP}} \,.
  \]
  Now, $\NP^{\class{QP}} \subseteq \class{QP}^\class{QP} \subseteq \class{QP} $
  by Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-collapse}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:qp-super-circ}
	$\class{QP}^{\class{\Sigma}^p_k}$ contains a language which does not belong
	to $\io \Ppoly$ for some $k \in \N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The proof follows a nonuniform diagonalization argument. We first define
	a language which will be hard to compute for any polynomial-size circuit
	family:
	Let $L'$ be the language consisting of tuples
	$\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle$
	with $n \coloneqq |x|$
	such that $C(x) = 1$ where $C$ is the
	lexicographically first circuit of size $\exp(\log^3 n)$ which is not
	computed by any circuit of size $\exp(\log^2 n)$.
	The existence of such a circuit for sufficiently large $n$ follows from a
	slightly more careful analysis of the nonuniform hierarchy theorem
	(Theorem~6.22).
	
	We can decide membership $\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle \in L'$
	by a $\class{\Sigma}^p_4$-oracle as in Problem~(1c) of Homework~7.
	Finally, we define our language $L$ of superpolynomial circuit complexity
	as the output of a $\class{QP}^{\class{\Sigma}^p_4}$-machine: Given an input
	$x \in \{0,1\}^n$, query the oracle for $L'$ with
	$\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle$ and output its answer.
	
	We constructed this language such that it is hard for a polynomial-size
	circuit to compute. To see this, assume to the contrary that there is
	a $n^a$-size circuit family.
	However, since $n^a \in o(\exp(\log^2 n))$ and we particularly excluded any
	circuits of size less than $\exp(\log^2 n)$, this is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:num-of-circs}
  There are $O(s^{3s})$ different circuits of size $s$.
  In particular, there are
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ circuits of size $\log^c n$ for any
      $c > 0$ and

    \item $O(2^{n^{2 \varepsilon}})$ circuits of size
      $n^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  In a circuit with $s \in \N$ many gates and inputs, each gate is connected to
  at most two out of $s$ gates, and computes one of the functions
  $\land, \lor, \neg$.
  This means, there are at most $3 \cdot s^2$ choices to construct each gate
  and thus $(3 s^2)^s = O(s^{3s})$ choices to construct the whole circuit.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Setting $s \coloneqq \log^c n$ gives us
      \[
        O((\log^c n)^{3 \log^c n})
        =
        O(2^{(\log^{3c} n) \cdot (\log^c n)})
        =
        O(2^{\log^{4c} n})
        =
        n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}
      \]
      many ways to construct a circuit of size $\log^c n$, while

    \item setting $s \coloneqq n^\varepsilon = 2^{\varepsilon \log n}$ yields
      $
        O((2^{\varepsilon \log n})^{n^\varepsilon})
        =
        O(2^{n^{2 \varepsilon}})
      $
      different circuits of size $n^\varepsilon$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Now, we are ready to look at the first key theorem which is about the implication for \textit{Circuit Complexity} if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under the \textit{natural} reduction.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{10.1145/335305.335314}]
  \label{thm:15}
  If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from
  $\mathprob{SAT}$, then $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions
  $f_k$ not in $\io \Ppoly$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We separate the prove along two cases.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Case 1: $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$

      Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-collapse} and Lemma~\ref{lem:ph-sub-qp} to
      this assumption yields
      $\class{QP}^{\class{PH}} \subseteq \class{QP}^{\class{QP}} \subseteq
       \class{QP} \subseteq \class{E}$.
      Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-super-circ} shows that $\class E$ also contains
      a language of superpolynomial circuit complexity (i.o.).
      % how does
      %   'a language of superpolynomial circuit complexity'
      % relate to
      %   'a family of Boolean functions not in P/poly'
      % ?
      Hence, $\class{E} \not\subseteq \io\Ppoly$\\
		
		\item Case 2: $\NP \not\subseteq \class{QP}$

      While it is (computationally) trivial to choose a no-instance for $\SAT$
      of any given size, it is not clear how to do so for $\mathprob{MCSP}$.
      The key idea for this part is, therefore, to use the natural reduction $R$
      to obtain hard instances for $\mathprob{MCSP}$, i.e. a family of
      truthtables which cannot be represented by ciruits of polynomial size.

      We start out by picking a quite arbitrary infinite set $U$ of 
      unsatisfiable CNF-formulae, say,
      $U \coloneqq \set{ \phi_n \mid n \in \N }$
      where
      \[
        \phi_n(x_1, \dots, x_n) \coloneqq
        (x_1 \land \bar x_1) \land
        (x_3 \land x_4 \land \cdots \cdots \cdots \land x_n) \,.
      \]
      By construction, $|\phi_n| \in \Theta(n)$.
      Now, based on this, we want to apply $R$ to define our hard language.
      %
      For each $k \in \N$, let $T_k$ be the truthtable in $k$-variables such
      that $\langle T_k, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$ and $n$ is minimal.
      If no $\phi_n$ maps to a truthtable in $k$ variables, simply let
      $T_k \equiv 0$.

      We know that $R$ is natural, which in particular implies
      $n^{1/c} \le |T_k| \le n^c$ (with an appropriate $c \in \N$)
      for every $\phi_n$ mapping to a truthtable $T_k$.
      Since $|T_k| = 2^k$, this is equivalent to
      $\log (n^{1/c}) \le k \le \log (n^c)$
      implying $k = \Theta(\log n)$ or $n = 2^{\Theta(k)}$.
      %
      Now, we proceed with defining our hard language
      \[
        L \coloneqq
        \set{
          x \in \{0,1\}^k \mid
          k \in \N,
          T_k(x) = 1
        }
      \]
      to obtain the following.
      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $L \in \class E$:
          %
          We show how to construct a machine to decide $L$ in time
          $2^{O(k)}$.
          Given an input $x \in \{0,1\}^k$, we first need to know which
          $\phi_n$ maps to $T_k$ under $R$.

          To each candidate $\phi_n$ for $n \in \N$, we apply $R$ and obtain
          $\langle T_{k'}, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$.
          We then compare whether $k = k'$ and if so, output $T_k(x)$.
          The reduction $R$ runs in polynomial time, say $n^a$ for an
          $a \in \N$.
          %
          By the above construction, $n = 2^{\Theta(k)}$ which means we
          only need to check $2^{\Theta(k)}$ candidates whereas each check
          runs in time at most $n^a = (2^{\Theta(k)})^a = 2^{\Theta(k)}$.
          %
          If no candidate maps to a truthtable on $k$ variables, we know
          that $T_k \equiv 0$ by definition and reject since
          $T_k(x) = 0 \not= 1$.
          %
          Overall, the decision procedure took time $2^{O(k)}$, proving
          that $L \in \class E$.

        \item $L \not\in \Ppoly$:
          We start by showing that the parameter $s_n$ produced by $R$ is
          superpolynomial in $\log n$.
          Let us thus assume to the contrary that it is bound by a polynomial
          $s_n \le \log^b n$ for any $b \in \N$.
          %
          Now, this yields a simple strategy to decide $\SAT$ in
          quasi-polynomial time:
          Given a CNF-formula $\phi$ of size $n$, we apply
          $R$ to obtain $\langle T_{k'}, s_n \rangle \coloneqq R(\phi)$
          with $s_n \le \log^b n$.
          We are going to decide the membership of this instance to
          $\mathprob{MSCP}$ instead of solving
          the original satisfiability problem.
          By Lemma~\ref{lem:num-of-circs}, there are at most
          $n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ circuits of size $s_n$.
          We enumerate these and check for each circuit whether
          it represents $T_{k'}$.
          Note that testing whether a circuit $C$ of size $s_n$ represents
          $T_{k'}$ only requires us to do $2^{k'}$ evaluations of $C$, each of
          which take time $O(s_n)$.
          Overall, we can decide the membership to $\mathprob{MCSP}$, and
          as such the satisfiability of $\phi$, in quasi-polynomial time.
          However, this implies that $\SAT \in \class{QP}$
          contradicting our assumption that $\NP \not\subseteq \class{QP}$.

          We therefore established that $s_n$ is superpolynomial in $\log n$.
          At the same time, $R$ is a natural reduction, meaning that $s_n$ is
          the same for every input of size $n$.
          In particular, we obtain that since we set
          $\langle T_k, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$, the parameter
          $s_n$ is superpolynomial in $\log n = \Theta(k)$.
          As $\phi_n$ is a no-instance to $\SAT$, we conclude that
          $T_k$ cannot be represented by a polynomial-size circuit family.
          In other words, $L \not\in \Ppoly$.
          %
          Being more careful, we furthermore obtain that any polynomial-size
          circuit family can only agree with $T_k$ on finitely many
          input lengths. The reason for this is that
          $s_n \in \omega(\mathrm{poly}(k))$ guarantees
          by definition the existence of a $k_0 \in \N$ such that
          $\mathrm{poly}(k) < s_n$ for all $k > k_0$.
          We conclude that $L \not\in \io \Ppoly$.
      \end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{10.1145/335305.335314}]
  If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from
  $\mathprob{SAT}$ and $\NP \not\subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$, then
  $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions
  $f_k$ of circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(k)}$ (i.o.)
  {\color{gray}(meaning not in $\io \mathrm{size}(2^{o(k)})$)}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  This proof follows similarly to the previous statement.
  In fact, let the language $L$ and pairs $\langle T_k, s_n \rangle$ be defined
  as in the proof for Theorem~\ref{thm:15}.
  The difference is that here, we show that a more restrictive bound on
  $s_n$ contradicts the stronger assumption $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$ as
  this bound would allow $\SAT$ to be solved in subexponential time.

  To this end, assume that $s_n \in O(n^\varepsilon)$ for any
  $\varepsilon > 0$.
  We pursue the same strategy to decide the satisfiability of a CNF formula
  $\phi$: Using the reduction $R$, map it to
  $\langle T_{k'}, s_n \rangle \coloneqq R(\phi)$.
  Lemma~\ref{lem:num-of-circs} shows that there are
  $O(2^{n^{2 \varepsilon}})$ circuits of size at most $s_n$.
  Enumerating all such circuits and checking whether they represent $T_{k'}$
  therefore takes time
  \[
    \underbrace{O(2^{n^{2 \varepsilon}})}_{\textrm{\#circuits}} \cdot
    \underbrace{O(2^{k'})}_{\textrm{\#entries}} \cdot 
    \underbrace{O(s_n)}_{\textrm{evaluate}}
    =
    O(2^{n^{2 \varepsilon}}) \cdot
    \mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot
    O(n^\varepsilon)
    =
    O(2^{n^{3 \varepsilon}}) \,.
  \]
  So, if we assume to the contrary that
  $s_n \in O(n^\varepsilon)$ for every $\varepsilon > 0$,
  we also obtain that we can decide the satisfiability of $\phi$ in time
  $O(2^{n^{3 \varepsilon}})$ for every $\varepsilon$, i.e.
  in subexponential time.
  However, $\SAT \in \class{SUBEXP}$
  contradicts the assumption $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$.

  We can conclude that instead, $s_n \in \Omega(n^\varepsilon)$
  for an $\varepsilon > 0$.
  With $n = 2^{\Theta(k)}$, this shows that
  $s_n \in \Omega(2^{\varepsilon \Theta(k)}) = 2^{\Omega(k)}$.
  %
  Now, with the same argument as above, we know that $L$ can only be decided
  by a $2^{\Omega(k)}$ size circuit family. We have already proven that
  $L \subseteq \mathbf E$, which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

Now, we will look at the implications for $\BPP$ when $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$. The following two theorems on hardness-randomness trade-offs are needed to establish the one about $\BPP$.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{impagliazzo1997}]
	If the class $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ of circuit complexity at least $2^{\epsilon n}$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, (i.o.), then $\BPP = \P$ (i.o.).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{babai1993bpp}]
	If the class $\EXP$ contains a family of Boolean functions of superpolynomial circuit complexity (i.o.), then $\BPP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$ (i.o.).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{10.1145/335305.335314}]
	\label{BPPimplication}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then
	\begin{enumerate} [1.]
		\item $\BPP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$ (i.o.), and
		\item $\BPP = \P$, unless $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} \
  [TODO]
\end{proof}

Intuitively speaking, if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then a problem in $\BPP$ can be efficiently solved. Finally, taking everything together, we obtain a nice corollary as follows.

\begin{corollary}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then $\BPP \subsetneq \class{E}$
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  [TODO] Idea: From Theorem \ref{BPPimplication}, we know that if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then $\BPP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$. Thus, we can diagonalize against $\class{SUBEXP}$ with a Turing Machine $M$ in $E$ and $M$ should mess up when the input length is large enough.
\end{proof}

\subsection{MCSP and P}
As mentioned previously, it is still unknown to us that whether we would be able to reduce $\mathprob{MCSP}$ to $\mathprob{SAT}$ using the natural Karp reduction. Namely, if such reduction exists, it yields some astonishing results (as stated in $3.1$) which are unlikely to be found soon. Nonetheless, the assumption that $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\P$ gives some surprising consequences. 

For starter, if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ can be efficiently solved, then we will be able to factor Blums integers \footnote{a Blum integer is the product of two primes, which congruent to $3$ mod $4$} well on the average case. Specifically, let us examine the following theorem and its consequence.

\begin{theorem}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\Ppoly$, then there is no strong pseudorandom generator in $\Ppoly$.
\end{theorem}

As a reminder, the definition of \textit{strong pseudorandom generators} can be found in section \ref{pseudorandom}. This theorem is a direct consequence of the main result of ``Natural Proofs'' by Razborov and Rudich \cite{10.1006/jcss.1997.1494}, and with that being said, this paper is the best reference for those who are interested in the proof of this theorem. In this sense, we obtain a consequence as follows.

\begin{corollary}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\P$, then, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is an algorithm running in time $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$ that factors Blum integers well on the average.
\end{corollary}

An example of a pseudorandom generator which is believed to be a strong one is a generator based on factoring Blum integers. Thus, the corollary above suggests that if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ can be efficiently solved, then we can ``break'' the strong pseudorandom generator of factoring Blum integers with a good enough average-case algorithm.  

In other words, if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\P$, then our current cryptography breaks because a fast algorithm for factoring (at least for the average-case) can break any type of cryptography. It is mainly believed that factoring is hard and therefore it is very much unlikely that $\mathprob{MCSP}$ can be efficiently solved; however, nothing has been shown to draw an ultimate conclusion about this assumption. We will now explore some other unlikely consequences that would happen if such proof exists.
