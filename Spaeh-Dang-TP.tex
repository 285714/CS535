\section{Introduction}

In the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP), we are given a truth table of some Boolean function together with a positive integer $s_n$ as input, and our task is to answer the question whether there exists a circuit of size at most $s_n$ that computes the function represented by the given truth table.

It is easy to see that $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is in $\NP$. Namely, we can define a certificate as some proposed circuit $C$ of size at most $s_n$, and verify whether $C$ computes each entry of the truth table correctly in polynomial time. With that being said, a natural question arises: Is $\mathprob{MCSP}$  $\NP$-complete?

In ``Circuit Minimization Problem,'' Valentine Kabanets and Jin-Yi Cai addressed the difficulty of showing $\mathprob{MCSP}$ to be $\NP$-hard \cite{10.1145/335305.335314}. They showed some consequences that are unlikely to happen if there exists a polynomial-time reduction $R$ from $\mathprob{SAT}$ to $\mathprob{MCSP}$ that is ``natural,'' in the sense that the size of the output depends on the size of the inputs only, and these sizes are polynomially related.  Furthermore, the authors pointed out why it is challenging to prove $\mathprob{MCSP} \notin \P$ (again, by providing some consequences whose likelihood is questionable). Clearly, such proof would imply $\P \neq \NP$ which goes beyond the currently known techniques. 

In this review, we will provide some definitions required to understand the main results and key theorems of the paper in Section 2. Section 3 introduces some main consequences when $\mathprob{MCSP} \notin \P$ and $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under ``natural'' reductions. Finally, we conclude the review by providing some insightful remarks and directions for further research on this topic in Section 4.

\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we provide the list of some definitions that, we believe, are useful for the readers.

\begin{definition}
	The class Sub-Exponential: $\class{SUBEXP} = \bigcap_{\epsilon > 0} \TIME(2^{n^{\epsilon}})$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	The class $\class{QP}$ of languages decided by a TM in
	\emph{quasi-polynomial} time defined by
	\[
	\class{QP}
	\coloneqq
	\TIME(n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)})
	=
	\bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(2^{\log^c n})
	=
	\bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(n^{\log^c n})
	\]
	where we obtain the last equality since
	\[
	2^{(\log n)^{c+1}} = \exp( \log^{c+1} n ) = \exp( \log n \log^c n )
	= n^{\log^c n} \,.
	\]
\end{definition}

Note that $\class{QP}$ contains $\P$ since
$\mathrm{polylog}(n) \in \Omega(1)$.
Also, $\class{SUBEXP}$ contains $\class{QP}$ since for every
$\varepsilon > 0$ and $c > 1$ holds that
$\exp(\log^c n) \in o(\exp(n^\varepsilon))$.

\begin{definition}
	The class exponential time with linear exponential is defined as
	$\class{E} \coloneqq \TIME(2^{O(n)})$.
\end{definition}

Since $\log^c n \in O(n)$ for any $c > 0$, we obtain that
$\class{QP} \subseteq \class E$.


\subsection{Natural Reductions}

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Natural (Karp) Reduction}: For two problems $A$ and $B$ and a Karp reduction from $A$ to $B$, we say the reduction $R$ is natural if, for any instance $I$ of $A$, the length of the output $|R(I)|$, as well as all possible output parameters $s_n$, depend only on the input length $|I|$. Furthermore, $|I|$ and $|R(I)|$ are polynomial related.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Proper definition of natural reductions as given in the PhD-thesis.
\end{definition}
	
	For example, $\mathprob{SAT} \leq_p \mathprob{3SAT}$ is ``natural.'' Namely, given $\varphi$ - an instance in $\mathprob{SAT}$, the general idea is to split some clause $C$ in $\varphi$ of size $k > 3$ into a pair of two equivalent clauses $C_1$ of size $k - 1$ and $C_2$ of size $3$ and we repeat the process until we get the desired $3-CNF$ formula, $\varphi'$. Thus, the length of $\varphi'$ is only dependent on $\varphi$ as we just add more clauses solely based on everything from the original formula, intuitively speaking.
	
	Other textbook reductions that we know and love (such as $\mathprob{3SAT} \leq_p \mathprob{VERTEXCOVER}$, etc.) are ``natural'' in this sense.
Unnatural reductions, on the other hand, are more contrived.
%
%
{\color{gray}
Consider, for example, the following reduction from
$\mathprob{Clique}$\footnote{
  The clique problem ($\mathprob{Clique}$) asks for an instance
  $\langle G, n \rangle$ of a graph $G$ and integer $n$, whether $G$ has
  a completely connected subgraph of size $n$.
}
to
$\mathprob{SubIso}$:\footnote{
  The subgraph isomorphism problem ($\mathprob{SubIso}$) asks, given two graphs
  $G$ and $H$, whether there is a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ which is isomorphic to
  $H$.
}
\[
  f(G, n) =
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \langle K_1, K_2 \rangle & \textrm{if } |V(G)| < n \\
      \langle G, K_{n} \rangle & \textrm{otherwise} \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
\]
where $K_n$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices.
Note that the reduction is correct since $G$ has a clique of size $n$ if and
only if it has a connected subgraph $K_n$. Also, $G$ cannot have a clique of
size $n$ if it does not even have $n$ vertices.
Also, the reduction can be carried out in polynomial time: In fact,
we can commpute the output size as
\[
  |f(G,n)| = 
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      O(1) & \textrm{if } |V(G)| < n \\
      \Theta(|G|) & \textrm{otherwise} \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
\]
However, $|f(G,n)|$ is certainly not a function in the input size $(|G|+n)$,
so this reduction is not natural.
%
With a little more care, we can still turn this reduction into a natural
reduction. We can define
\[
  f'(G, n) =
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \langle G \cup \bar K_{\log n}, G \rangle & \textrm{if } |V(G)| < n \\
      \langle G, K_{n} \rangle & \textrm{otherwise} \\
    \end{array}
  \right.
\]
where $G \cup H$ denotes the union of two graphs $G$ and $H$ where
$\bar K_m$ is the empty graph on $m$ vertices.
Now, the output size is $|f'(G,n)| = \Theta(|G|)$ in both cases.}
%
%
\begin{example}
  We reduce from
  $\mathprob{Partition}$\footnote{The partition problem asks, given a multiset
  of positive integers $\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ whether there exists a partition
  $(S,T)$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ such that
  $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = \sum_{i \in T} a_i$.}
  to
  $\mathprob{SubsetSum}:$\footnote{The partition problem asks for an instance
  $\langle A, s \rangle$ of a multiset of positive integers
  $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ and an integer $s$ whether there exists a subset
  $S \subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ such that
  $s = \sum_{i \in S} a_i$.}
  \[
    R(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \coloneqq
    \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \langle \{2, 4, 8\}, 7 \rangle
          & \textrm{if } \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \equiv_2 1 \\
        \langle \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}, \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \rangle
          & \textrm{otherwise} \,. \\
      \end{array}
    \right.
  \]
  Now, while this reduction is correct (if $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ is congruent to 1
  modulo 2, it is impossible to divide the set into two partitions of equal sum;
  the tuple $\langle \{2, 4, 8\}, 7 \rangle$ is a no-instance to
  $\mathprob{SubsetSum}$) and can be carried out in polynomial time.
  It is not natural for two reasons:
  First, the output size does not strictly depend on the input size as, in the
  case of an obvious no-instance to $\mathprob{Partition}$, we map directly to a
  no-instance of $\mathprob{SubsetSum}$ of constant size.
  Second, the numerical parameter $s$ is not a function of the input
  size only. For example, the two instances $\{1, \dots, 1\}$ ($n$-times) and
  $\{2^n\}$ are of equal size, but have totally different sums.
  With a little more care, we can, however, make this a natural reduction: Let
  \[
    \begin{array}{rrl}
      R'(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \coloneqq
        \langle \{2 a_1, \dots, 2 a_n, r,
         2^{\sigma+2} \rangle
      &\textrm{where}&
      \sigma \coloneqq \mathrm{size}(\{a_1, \dots, a_n\}) \\
      &\textrm{and}&
      r \coloneqq 2^{\sigma+2} - \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \,.
    \end{array}
  \]
  Now, the numerical parameter $s$ is obviously only a function in the input
  size $\sigma$. Regarding correctness, first note that
  $2^{\sigma+2} > \sum_{i=1}^n 2 a_i$. This implies that any subset with a sum
  of $2^{\sigma+2}$ necessarily contains $r$ and thus
  \[
    \textstyle
    2^{\sigma+2} = r + \sum_{i \in S} 2a_i
    \iff
    \frac 1 2 \sum_{i=1}^n = \sum_{i \in S} a_i
  \]
  where $S$ is the rest of the subset without $r$.
\end{example}


\section{Main Results}

\subsection{MCSP and NP-completeness}

To begin with, we want to emphasize that researchers have not figured out yet whether it is possible to prove the $\NP$-hardness of $\mathprob{MCSP}$ or not. The difficulty of such proof was explicitly addressed through some implications for \textit{Circuit Complexity} and $\BPP$. In other words, the authors provided some consequences that are still unknown to the current state of the art if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under the ``natural'' Karp reduction. 

Before we move on to some key theorems of this section, let us examine some lemmas that are useful for establishing.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:qp-collapse}
	$\class{QP}^{\class{QP}} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $M$ be a TM dedicing a language $L \in \class{QP}^{\class{QP}}$ in
  quasi-polynomial time, say $\exp(\log^c n)$.
  We show that carrying out the oracle computation instead of calling the
  oracle does still guarantee a quasi-polynomial running time. To this end,
  let $M'$ be the TM deciding the $\class{QP}$-oracle, say in time
  $\exp(\log^{c'} m)$.
  Now, any input to $M'$ is at most of length $m = \exp(\log^c n)$. We
  therefore need time at most
  $\exp(\log^c (\exp(\log^c n))) = \exp(\log^{cc'} n)$
  for one oracle computation. At the same time, there are at most
  $\exp(\log^c n)$ calls, resulting in a total running time bound of
  $\exp(\log^c (\exp(\log^{cc'} n))) = \exp(\log^{c^2 c'} n)$
  which is still quasi-polynomial.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:ph-sub-qp}
	If $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$ then
	$\class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Recall that we can define $\class{PH}$ in terms of oracles by
  \[
    \class{PH} =
    \bigcup_{n > 0} \underbrace{\NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}}_{n \textrm{ times}}
    \,.
  \]
  We can use a straithgforward induction over $n$ to show that
  $\class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
  Note that the induction basis is just the assumption.
  Furthermore, by the inductive hypothesis, we have that
  \[
    \underbrace{\NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}}_{n \textrm{ times}}
    \subseteq
    \class{QP}
    \quad
    \Longrightarrow
    \quad
    \underbrace{\NP^{\overbrace{
      \NP^{\NP^{\cdots^{\NP}}}
    }^{n \textrm{ times}}}}_{n+1 \textrm{ times}}
    \subseteq
    \NP^{\class{QP}} \,.
  \]
  Now, $\NP^{\class{QP}} \subseteq \class{QP}^\class{QP} \subseteq\QP $
  by Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-collapse}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:qp-super-circ}
	$\class{QP}^{\class{\Sigma}^p_k}$ contains a language which does not belong
	to $\Ppoly$ for some $k \in \N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The proof follows a nonuniform diagonalization argument. We first define
	a language which will be hard to compute for any polynomial-size circuit
	family:
	Let $L'$ be the language consisting of tuples
	$\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle$
	with $n \coloneqq |x|$
	such that $C(x) = 1$ where $C$ is the
	lexicographically first circuit of size $\exp(\log^3 n)$ which is not
	computed by any circuit of size $\exp(\log^2 n)$.
	The existence of such a circuit for sufficiently large $n$ follows from a
	slightly more careful analysis of the nonuniform hierarchy theorem
	(Theorem~6.22).
	
	We can decide membership $\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle \in L'$
	by a $\class{\Sigma}^p_4$-oracle as in Problem~(1c) of Homework~7.
	Finally, we define our language $L$ of superpolynomial circuit complexity
	as the output of a $\class{QP}^{\class{\Sigma}^p_4}$-machine: Given an input
	$x \in \{0,1\}^n$, query the oracle for $L'$ with
	$\langle x, 1^{\exp(\log^3 n)} \rangle$ and output its answer.
	
	We constructed this language such that it is hard for a polynomial-size
	circuit to compute. To see this, assume to the contrary that there is
	a $n^a$-size circuit family.
	However, since $n^a \in o(\exp(\log^2 n))$ and we particularly excluded any
	circuits of size less than $\exp(\log^2 n)$, this is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:num-of-circs}
  There are at most $n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ different circuits of size
  $\log^c n$ for a constant $c$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  In a circuit with $s \in \N$ many gates and inputs, each gate is connected to
  at most two out of $s$ gates, and computes one of the functions
  $\land, \lor, \neg$.
  This means, there are at most $3 \cdot s^2$ choices to construct each gate
  and thus $(3 s^2)^s$ choices to construct the whole circuit.
  Setting $s \coloneqq \log^c n$ gives us
  \[
    % O-notation missing....
    (3 \log^{2c} n)^{\log^c n}
    =
    O(\exp((\log^{2c} n) \cdot (\log^c n)))
    =
    O(\exp(\log^{3c} n))
    =
    n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}
  \]
  many ways to construct a circuit of size $\log^c n$.
\end{proof}

Now, we are ready to look at the first key theorem which is about the implication for \textit{Circuit Complexity} if $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under the \textit{natural} reduction.

\begin{theorem}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then
	\begin{enumerate} [1.]
		\item $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n$ not in $\Ppoly$ (i.o.), and
		\item $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n$ of circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$ (i.o.), unless $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$
      [the proof for this is yet missing]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We separate the prove along two cases.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Case 1: $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$

      Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-collapse} and Lemma~\ref{lem:ph-sub-qp} to this assumption yields that
      $\class{QP}^{\class{PH}} \subseteq \class{QP}^{\class{QP}} \subseteq
       \class{QP} \subseteq \class{E}$.
      Lemma~\ref{lem:qp-super-circ} shows that $\class E$ also contains
      a language of superpolynomial circuit complexity.
      % how does
      %   'a language of superpolynomial circuit complexity'
      % relate to
      %   'a family of Boolean functions not in P/poly'
      % ?
      Hence, $\class{E} \not\subseteq \Ppoly$\\
		
		\item Case 2: $\NP \not\subseteq \class{QP}$

      While it is (computationally) trivial to choose a no-instance for $\SAT$
      of any given size, it is not clear how to do so for $\mathprob{MCSP}$.
      The key idea for this part is, therefore, to use the natural reduction $R$
      to obtain hard instances for $\mathprob{MCSP}$, i.e. a family of
      truthtables which cannot be represented by ciruits of polynomial size.

      We start out by picking a quite arbitrary infinite set $U$ of 
      unsatisfiable CNF-formulae, say,
      $U \coloneqq \set{ \phi_n \mid n \in \N }$
      where
      \[
        \phi_n(x_1, \dots, x_n) \coloneqq
        (x_1 \land \bar x_1) \land
        (x_3 \land x_4 \land \cdots \cdots \cdots \land x_n) \,.
      \]
      By construction, $|\phi_n| \in \Theta(n)$.
      Now, based on this, we want to apply $R$ to define our hard language.
      %
      For each $k \in \N$, let $T_k$ be the truthtable in $k$-variables such
      that $\langle T_k, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$ and $n$ is minimal.
      If no $\phi_n$ maps to a truthtable in $k$ variables, simply let
      $T_k \equiv 0$.

      We know that $R$ is natural, which in particular implies
      $n^{1/c} \le |T_k| \le n^c$ (with an appropriate $c \in \N$)
      for every $\phi_n$ mapping to a truthtable $T_k$.
      Since $|T_k| = 2^k$, this is equivalent to
      $\log (n^{1/c}) \le k \le \log (n^c)$
      implying $k = \Theta(\log n)$ or $n = 2^{\Theta(k)}$.
      %
      Now, we proceed with defining our hard language
      \[
        L \coloneqq
        \set{
          x \in \{0,1\}^k \mid
          k \in \N,
          T_k(x) = 1
        }
      \]
      to obtain the following.
      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item $L \in \class E$:
          %
          We show how to construct a machine to decide $L$ in time
          $2^{O(k)}$.
          Given an input $x \in \{0,1\}^k$, we first need to know which
          $\phi_n$ maps to $T_k$ under $R$.

          To each candidate $\phi_n$ for $n \in \N$, we apply $R$ and obtain
          $\langle T_{k'}, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$.
          We then compare whether $k = k'$ and if so, output $T_k(x)$.
          The reduction $R$ runs in polynomial time, say $n^a$ for an
          $a \in \N$.
          %
          By the above construction, $n = 2^{\Theta(k)}$ which means we
          only need to check $2^{\Theta(k)}$ candidates whereas each check
          runs in time at most $n^a = (2^{\Theta(k)})^a = 2^{\Theta(k)}$.
          %
          If no candidate maps to a truthtable on $k$ variables, we know
          that $T_k \equiv 0$ by definition and reject since
          $T_k(x) = 0 \not= 1$.
          %
          Overall, the decision procedure took time $2^{O(k)}$, proving
          that $L \in \class E$.

        \item $L \not\in \Ppoly$:
          We start by showing that the parameter $s_n$ produced by $R$ is
          superpolynomial in $\log n$.
          Let us thus assume to the contrary that it is bound by a polynomial
          $s_n \le \log^b n$ for any $b \in \N$.
          %
          Now, this yields a simple strategy to decide $\SAT$ in
          quasi-polynomial time:
          Given a CNF-formula $\phi$ of size $n$, we apply
          $R$ to obtain $\langle T_{k'}, s_n \rangle \coloneqq R(\phi)$
          with $s_n \le \log^b n$.
          We are going to decide the membership of this instance to
          $\mathprob{MSCP}$ instead of solving
          the original satisfiability problem.
          By Lemma~\ref{lem:num-of-circs}, there are at most
          $n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$ circuits of size $s_n$.
          We enumerate these and check for each circuit whether
          it represents $T_{k'}$.
          Note that testing whether a circuit $C$ of size $s_n$ represents
          $T_{k'}$ only requires us to do $2^{k'}$ evaluations of $C$, each of
          which take time $O(s_n)$.
          Overall, we can decide the membership to $\mathprob{MCSP}$, and
          as such the satisfiability of $\phi$, in quasi-polynomial time.
          However, this implies that $\SAT \in \class{QP}$
          contradicting our assumption that $\NP \not\subseteq \class{QP}$.

          We therefore established that $s_n$ is superpolynomial in $\log n$.
          At the same time, $R$ is a natural reduction, meaning that $s_n$ is
          the same for every input of size $n$.
          In particular, we obtain that since we set
          $\langle T_k, s_n \rangle = R(\phi_n)$, the parameter
          $s_n$ is superpolynomial in $\log n = \Theta(k)$.
          As $\phi_n$ is a no-instance to $\SAT$, we conclude that
          $T_k$ cannot be represented by a polynomial-size circuit family.
          In other words, $L \not\in \Ppoly$.
      \end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Now, we will look at the implications for $\BPP$ when $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$. The following two theorems on hardness-randomness trade-offs are needed to establish the one about $\BPP$.

\begin{theorem}[\cite{impagliazzo1997}]
	If the class $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ of circuit complexity at least $2^{\epsilon n}$ for some $\epsilon > 0$, (i.o.), then $\BPP = \P$ (i.o.).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\cite{babai1993bpp}]
	If the class $\EXP$ contains a family of Boolean functions of superpolynomial circuit complexity (i.o.), then $\BPP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$ (i.o.).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then
	\begin{enumerate} [1.]
		\item $\BPP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$ (i.o.), and
		\item $\BPP = \P$, unless $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Taking everything together, we obtain a nice corollary as follows.

\begin{corollary}
	If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then $\BPP \subsetneq \class{E}$
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Idea: diagonalize against $\class{SUBEXP}$ with a Turing Machine $M$ in $E$ and $M$ should mess up when the input length is large enough.
\end{proof}

\subsection{MCSP and P}
[We plan to discuss some implication for hard functions in uniform complexity class (2.4) and Zero-sided and One-sided error (2.5)] 

\section{Conclusion}

[Will be added when we are done with section 3, but basically, we plan to briefly introduce some other work that tackled the open problems introduced in this paper and then conclude with some further plans of research.]
