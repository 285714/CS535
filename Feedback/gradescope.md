# Introduction

It would enrich your introduction a lot to provide some context for why this is a natural and interesting problem. I.e., it captures the complexity of doing complexity theory (proving circuit lower bounds).

# Thm "If MSCP is NP-hard ..."

It may be a good idea to break the statement of this into two theorems, especially if you do plan to include full proofs of both.

# Proof for Corollary

Are you planning to spell this proof out in full? If not, call it a "proof sketch" and give a little more of an explanation.

# Overall

This is a really great start! Your technical sections are very nicely written and do an excellent job of fleshing out the proofs by connecting it back to material from the course. My main comment is that it would be nice to include some more (informal) discussion about why MCSP is a natural and interesting computational problem for its own sake. This should go into the introduction, and would also support some of the directions in the conclusion you will write.
