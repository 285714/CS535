abstract = {We introduce the notion ofnaturalproof. We argue that the known proofs of lower bounds on the complexity of explicit Boolean functions in nonmonotone models fall within our definition of natural. We show, based on a hardness assumption, that natural proofs can not prove superpolynomial lower bounds for general circuits. Without the hardness assumption, we are able to show that they can not prove exponential lower bounds (for general circuits) for the discrete logarithm problem. We show that the weaker class ofAC0-natural proofs which is sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of Furst, Saxe, and Sipser, Yao, and H stad is inherently incapable of proving the bounds of Razborov and Smolensky. We give some formal evidence that natural proofs are indeed natural by showing that every formal complexity measure, which can prove superpolynomial lower bounds for a single function, can do so for almost all functions, which is one of the two requirements of a natural proof in our sense.},

abstract = "We present a simple new construction of a pseudorandom bit generator. It stretches a short string of truly random bits into a long string that looks random to any algorithm from a complexity class C (e.g., P, NC, PSPACE, …) using an arbitrary function that is hard for C. This construction reveals an equivalence between the problem of proving lower bounds and the problem of generating good pseudorandom sequences. Our construction has many consequences. The most direct one is that efficient deterministic simulation of randomized algorithms is possible under much weaker assumptions than previously known. The efficiency of the simulations depends on the strength of the assumptions, and may achieve P = BPP. We believe that our results are very strong evidence that the gap between randomized and deterministic complexity is not large. Using the known lower bounds for constant depth circuits, our construction yields an unconditionally proven pseudorandom generator for constant depth circuits. As an application of this generator we characterize the power of NP with a random oracle."
