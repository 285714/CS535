\paragraph{MCSP} the input is a truth table (of length $2^n$) representing a Boolean function $f_n: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ and a number $s_n \in \N$ (encoded in binary). Question: is $f_n$ computable by a Boolean circuit of size at most $s_n$?

\bigskip
\paragraph{Natural Reduction} For two problems $A$ and $B$ and a Karp reduction from $A$ to $B$, we say the reduction $R$ is natural if, for any instance $I$ of $A$, the length of the output $|R(I)|$, as well as all possible output parameters $s_n$, depend only on the input length $|I|$. Furthermore, $|I|$ and $|R(I)|$ are polynomial related.

Example: $\mathprob{SAT} \leq_p \mathprob{3SAT}$ is natural. 

Question(s): What is output parameter $s_n$? Example?

\section{Some definitions:}
\begin{enumerate} [1.]
	\item The class Sub-Exponential: $\class{SUBEXP} = \bigcap_{\epsilon > 0} \TIME(2^{n^{\epsilon}})$
  \item The class $\class{QP}$ of languages decided by a TM in
    \emph{quasi-polynomial} time defined by
    \[
      \class{QP}
      \coloneqq
      \TIME(n^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)})
      =
      \bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(2^{\log^c n})
      =
      \bigcup_{c > 1}\TIME(n^{\log^c n})
    \]
    where we obtain the last equality since
    \[
      2^{(\log n)^{c+1}} = \exp( \log^{c+1} n ) = \exp( \log n \log^c n )
      = n^{\log^c n} \,.
    \]
    Note that $\class{QP}$ contains $\P$ since $\mathrm{polylog}(n) \in \Omega(1)$.
	\item The class exponential time with linear exponential: $\class{E} = \TIME(2^{O(n)})$
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\begin{lemma}
  If $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$ then
  $\class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We first show that $\NP = \exists \P \subseteq \class{QP}$ also implies that
  $\exists \class{QP} \subseteq \class{QP}$ by a padding
  argument.\footnote{The class $\exists \class{QP}$ is defined to consist of
  all languages $L$ such that there exists a quasi-polynomial TM $M$ and a
  polynomial $p$ with $x \in L \iff \exists y \in \{0,1\}^{p(|x|)}\
  M(x,y) = 1$}
  To this end, assume that $L \in \exists \class{QP}$ such that it is decided
  by a $\exp(\log^c n)$-time verifier $M$.
  We define our padded language as
  $L_{\textrm{pad}} \coloneqq \set{ x 1^{\exp(\log^c n)} \mid x \in L }$.
  We obtain that $L_{\textrm{pad}} \in \exists \P$ since applying $M$ to a
  padded element takes takes only linear time.
  It follows by our assumption that $L_{\textrm{pad}} \in \class{QP}$;
  say $L_{\textrm{pad}}$ is decided by an $\exp(\log^{c'} n)$-time TM $M'$.
  Now, the key idea lies in showing that this already implies
  $L \in \class{QP}$:
  Let $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ be of length $n \coloneqq |x|$ and
  its padded version $y \coloneqq x 1^{\exp(\log^c n)}$ of length
  $m = \exp(\log^c n)$. Then, the time needed by $M'$ to decide $y$ is
  \[
    \exp(\log^{c'} m)
    =
    \exp(\log^{c'}(\exp(\log^c n)))
    =
    \exp(\log^{c \cdot c'} n)
  \]
  which is again quasi-polynomial in $n$.
  Therefore, we can decide $x \in L$ by applying padding and running $M'$ all
  in quasi-polynomial time.

  The second step is to show that also
  $\forall \class{QP} \subseteq \class{QP}$.
  By definition, given a language $L \in \forall \class{QP}$, there exists a
  polynomial $p$ and a quasi-polynomial time verifier $M$ such that
  \[
    x \in L \iff \forall y \in \{0,1\}^{p(|x|)}\ M(x,y) = 1 \,.
  \]
  However, the right hand side is equivalent to the negation of
  $(\exists y \in \{0,1\}^{p(|x|)}\ M(x,y) = 0)$, a statement which can itself
  be decided in quasi-polynomial time by the above argument.
  Since all quasi-polynomial time TMs are also deterministic, we can also
  negate the output efficiently. It follows that $L \in \class{QP}$.

  By an inductive argument, we see that $\class{PH}$ collapses into a subset of
  $\class{QP}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 15]
If $\mathprob{MCSP}$ is $\NP$-hard under a natural reduction from $\mathprob{SAT}$, then
\begin{enumerate} [1.]
	\item $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n$ not in $\Ppoly$ (i.o.), and
	\item $\class{E}$ contains a family of Boolean functions $f_n$ of circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$ (i.o.), unless $\NP \subseteq \class{SUBEXP}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}[-]
	\item Statement 1: consider two cases
	\begin{enumerate} [+]
		\item Case 1: $\NP \subseteq \class{QP}$
		
		It is obvious to see that $\NP \subseteq \class{QP} \implies \class{PH} \subseteq \class{QP}$ (think of this as a generalisation of $\NP \subseteq \P \implies \class{PH} \subseteq \P$). Also, we make an observation that $\class{QP}^{\Sigma_k^p}$, for some $k \in \N$, contains a language of superpolynomial circuit complexity. The proof of this claim is as follow: (help!!!!)
		
		Combining these two results, we get the following $\NP \subseteq \class{QP} \implies \class{QP}^{\class{PH}} \subseteq \class{QP}^{\class{QP}} \subseteq \class{QP} \subset \class{E}$ contains a family of function not in $\Ppoly$. 
		
		Hence, $\class{E} \not\subseteq \Ppoly$\\
		
		\item Case 2: $\NP \not\subseteq \class{QP}$
		
		A given natural reduction $R$ from $\mathprob{SAT}$ to $\mathprob{MCSP}$ maps every family of boolean formulas of size $n$  to truth tables of Boolean functions on $k = \theta(\log n)$ variables (is the symbol $\theta$ significant? more elaboration on $\theta(\log n)$, like why is that?) and a parameter $s_n$.
		
		Since the reduction is natural, $s_n$ is some function of $n$ only and thus it could be some fixed polynomial $\log^c n$. Since there are at most [$\dots$] (fill in the gap, I don't really understand why they said there are $n^{\text{polylog(n)}}$ circuits) that many different circuits on $k$ inputs given $\log^c n$ gates. Thus, all such instances of $\mathprob{MCSP}$ where $s_n = \log^c n$, for some constant $c$, are solvable in quasi-polynomial time. This implies that $\mathprob{SAT} \in \class{QP}$ which is a contradiction to our assumption since $\mathprob{SAT}$ is $\NP$-complete. (should we say something about the relationship between $k$ and $\log n$? My understanding is that what we have shown here implies that the circuit size $s_n \neq \log^c n$ which is related to something like $k^c$, i.e. can't get a circuit of poly(k) size which leads to the thing below)
		
		Therefore, we can obtain the desired k-variable functions not in $\Ppoly$ by applying the reduction $R$ to any trivial family of unsatisfiable formulas. Clearly, this family of hard functions is computable in time $2^{O(k)}$. (maybe more elaboration on this too...).
		
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Statement 2: the proof is similar (you want to do it too?)
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
